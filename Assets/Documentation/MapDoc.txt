Tile class

Tiles should 
int xLoc;
int yLoc;
int zLoc;//should this be height? Makes sense that it would just be z so it can be held easily in a 3d array


enum e_TileType
{
	GROUND,
}

enum e_tileContents
{
	EMPTY,
	ALLY,
	ENEMY,
	NEUTRAL,//potentially unused
	OBSTACLE
}

will need sprite array of colors for different terrain

will need to be able to save this to a file
